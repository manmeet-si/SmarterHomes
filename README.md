# SmarterHomes

This is a project for the Operating Systems CMPSCI 677 class at UMass Amherst.
The aim of this project is to create a distributed system to simulate the Internet-of-Things.

Specific techniques in used in this project will be updated at a later date when we
aren't so busy actually writing code.
